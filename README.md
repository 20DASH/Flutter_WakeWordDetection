Welcome to **Davoice WakeWord / Keywords Detection** – Wake words and keyword detection solution designed by **DaVoice.io**.

## About this project

This is a **"wake word"** package for **"Flutter"**. A wake word is a keyword that activates your device, like "Hey Siri" or "OK Google". "Wake Word" is also known as "keyword detection", "Phrase Recognition", "Phrase Spotting", “Voice triggered”, “hotword”, “trigger word”

It also provide **Speech to Intent**. **Speech to Intent** refers to the ability to recognize a spoken word or phrase
and directly associate it with a specific action or operation within an application. Unlike a **"wake word"**, which typically serves to activate or wake up the application,
Speech to Intent goes further by enabling complex interactions and functionalities based on the recognized intent behind the speech.

For example, a wake word like "Hey App" might activate the application, while Speech
to Intent could process a phrase like "Play my favorite song" or "Order a coffee" to
execute corresponding tasks within the app.
Speech to Intent is often triggered after a wake word activates the app, making it a key
component of more advanced voice-controlled applications. This layered approach allows for
seamless and intuitive voice-driven user experiences.

# Wake word generator

## Create your "custom wake word""

In order to generate your custom wake word you will need to:

- **Create wake word mode:**
    Contact us at info@davoice.io with a list of your desired **"custom wake words"**.

    We will send you corresponding models typically your **wake word phrase .onnx** for example:

    A wake word ***"hey sky"** will correspond to **hey_sky.onnx**.

- **Add wake words to Android:**
    Simply copy the new onnx files to:

    android/app/src/main/assets/*.onnx

- **Add Wake word to IOS**
    Copy new models somewhere under ios/YourProjectName.

    You can create a folder ios/YourProjectName/models/ and copy there there.

    Now add each onnx file to xcode making sure you opt-in “copy if needed”.

- **In Dart code add the new onnx files to your configuration**
  
    Change:

```
  final List<InstanceConfig> instanceConfigs = [
    InstanceConfig(
      id: 'need_help_now',
      modelName: 'need_help_now.onnx',
      threshold: 0.9999,
      bufferCnt: 3,
      sticky: false,
    ),
  ];
```

To your generated custom wake word, for example if you wake word is "hey sky":

```
  final List<InstanceConfig> instanceConfigs = [
    InstanceConfig(
      id: 'hey_sky',
      modelName: 'hey_sky.onnx',
      threshold: 0.9999,
      bufferCnt: 3,
      sticky: false,
    ),
  ];

```

- **Last step - Rebuild your project**

## Installation and Usage

## Benchmark.

Our customers have benchmarked our technology against leading solutions, including Picovoice Porcupine, Snowboy, Pocketsphinx, Sensory, and others. 
In several tests, our performance was comparable to Picovoice Porcupine, occasionally surpassing it, however both technologies consistently outperformed all others in specific benchmarks. 
For detailed references or specific benchmark results, please contact us at ofer@davoice.io.

## Activating Microphone while the app operates in the background or during shutdown/closure.
This example in the Git repository enables Android functionality in both the foreground and background, and iOS functionality in the foreground. However, we have developed an advanced SDK that allows the microphone to be activated from a complete shutdown state on Android and from the background state on iOS. If you require this capability for your app, please reach out to us at ofer@davoice.io.
